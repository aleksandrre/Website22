          <p>
            We are a couple of nomads who used to explore the globe. The day we
            stepped our foot on Balinese ground one thing was clear - we fell in
            love. We kept coming back every few months and understood that this
            is a love affair for a lifetime. We fully moved here in 2018 and
            been exploring the island ever since. We’re excited to share what
            we’ve found and show you this beautiful corner of the world.
